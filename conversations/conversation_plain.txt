2411 This question doesn't provide information about the colony shown. As per the request, I'll make an educated guess based on common colonial locations.

2414 The probability for a typical Mendelian dihybrid cross where both traits follow simple dominance is 9:3:3:1. In this context, if we're discussing wing types in fruit flies, it could be presumed that normal wings might be dominant. In that case, the probability of having normal wings would be 3/4.
